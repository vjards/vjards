 # Hey Yall! I’m Victoria and I live in Houston, Texas.👩🏽
 *I'm a front-end web developer that specializes in building eye-catching and responsive websites for online coaches + course creators.*
 
 The reason I chose to become a professional web developer is because I love expressing my analytical and creative abilities to create and maintain interactive sites.
 
 While I'm an not developing websites my favorite hobbies include:
 
 - Crossword Puzzles🧩
 - Pilates & HIIT Cardio🏋🏽‍♀️
 - Eating Dark Chocolate 🍫
 - Watching Chicago Med, 911, and The Resident (basically all medical dramas)📺
